## Install Docker Engine
Install Docker Engine [following the official Docker instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Ensure you have a working Docker installation by running `docker version`.

## Download and install `spin`
Run the installer with this simple command in your terminal

::code-panel
---
label: Install spin (no root permissions required)
---
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)"
```
::

The above script will install spin at the _user_ level in `~/.spin`, using less than 300KB of storage.

## Add `spin` to your PATH
In order for your terminal to know where `spin` is located, we need to add this to your "PATH" for your shell. Depending on your shell, you will need to **paste the following text at the BOTTOM of the appropriate file**:

::note
Run `echo $0` in your terminal to figure out which shell you are using.
::


::code-panel
---
label: Add spin to your path
---
```bash
# Add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"
```
::

Files to modify:
- **ZSH (most modern Macs):** ~/.zshrc
- **Bash:** ~/.bash_profile

You can use something like `nano` or `vim` to modify these files.

## Apply your changes
To apply the changes, simply restart your terminal or you can source the file you just modified:

::code-panel
---
label: Use the "source" command to apply your profile changes immediately
---
```bash
# If you're using ZSH
source ~/.zshrc

# If you're using Bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```
::

## Configure Docker Compose V2
Spin is set to run the latest version of Docker Compose. By default, Linux still ships with V1. You can follow Docker's official steps on [ How to Install Docker Compose V2 →](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#install-on-linux)

## Verify your user can run Docker commands
::note
Make sure your user has access to manage the Docker daemon.
::

::code-panel
---
label: Check you have permissions to access the `docker` command
---
```bash
docker compose version
```
::

### ❌ If you run into an error: Add your user to the Docker Group
If your user does not have access to the Docker Daemon, follow these steps:

::code-panel
---
label: Ensure the "docker" group is created
---
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Add your user to the "docker" group
---
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Activate changes to your group
---
```bash
newgrp docker
```
::

## Validate `spin` is working


::code-panel
---
label: Confirm spin is working correctly by getting the version
---
```bash
spin version
```
