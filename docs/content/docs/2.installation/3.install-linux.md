## Pre-requisites
You must have a working installation of Docker.

::note
Most Docker documentation will push you to install "Docker Desktop" on your Linux machine. This is completely unnecessary in our opinion. Instead of "Docker Desktop", we suggest installing the "Docker Engine" instead.
::

### Install Docker Engine

Install "Docker Engine" following the official installation instructions:
- [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
- [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) (NOT for Ubuntu. Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for Ubuntu)
- [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
- [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/)
- [SLES](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/sles/)
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Raspbian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/raspberry-pi-os/)
- [Binaries](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/)

### Configure Docker permissions
Using the [post-installation instructions defined by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/), be sure to add your current user to the `docker` group if you want to be able to run Docker without root privileges.

::code-panel
---
label: Create the `docker` group
---
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Add your current user to the `docker` group.
---
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Activate the changes to groups.
---
```bash
newgrp docker
```
::

### Ensure Docker is working
To test you have a working version of Docker, you can run their "hello world" container. `docker version`.

::code-panel
---
label: Run a "hello world" container to ensure Docker works correctly
---
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
::

### Check your Docker Compose Version
Spin is set to run the latest version of Docker Compose (Version 2).


::code-panel
---
label: Check your Docker Compose version
---
```bash
docker compose version
```
::

If you do not see version 2.x installed, you'll need to update. [ How to Install Docker Compose V2 →](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#install-on-linux)


## Download and install `spin`
Run the installer with this simple command in your terminal

::code-panel
---
label: Install Spin (no root permissions required)
---
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)"
```
::

The above script will install spin at the _user_ level in `~/.spin`, using less than 300KB of storage.

## Add `spin` to your PATH
In order for your terminal to know where `spin` is located, we need to add this to your "PATH" for your shell. Depending on your shell, you will need to **paste the following text at the BOTTOM of the appropriate file**:


::code-panel
---
label: Add spin to your path (singe-line, hassle free)
---
```bash
echo $0 && { [ "$0" = "-bash" ] && file=~/.bash_profile || file=~/.zshrc; } && { [ -f "$file" ] || touch "$file"; } && grep -qxF 'export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"' "$file" || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"' >> "$file" && source "$file" && echo "✅ Spin path added and sourced successfully!"
```
::

This giant command above does a few things:
- It checks to see if you're using Bash or ZSH
- It checks to see if your shell profile file exists
- It checks to see if the `spin` path is already added to your shell profile file
- If the `spin` path is not added, it adds it to the bottom of your shell profile file
- It sources your shell profile file so you don't have to restart your terminal

Just copy and paste the above command into your terminal and it will intelligently add the `spin` path to your shell profile file.

## Validate `spin` is working

::code-panel
---
label: Confirm spin is working correctly by getting the version
---
```bash
spin version
```
