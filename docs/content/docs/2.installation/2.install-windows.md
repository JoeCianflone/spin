## Pre-requisites
Windows requires a "subsystem Linux" distribution which takes some configuring on a brand new machine. Once configured, Linux will be running as a virtual machine on your Windows computer, allowing you to run Docker.

You'll need the following services configured on your Windows machine:
* Windows Subsystem Linux
* Docker Desktop

## Prepare your Windows Machine

### Install The Kernel Update

To prevent errors with Docker Desktop, be sure to have the latest Linux Kernel update installed. [Refer to the documentation for download →](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package)

If you do not install this update, you will see this error on launch of Docker Desktop.

### Install Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)

::note
The Official documentation for installing WSL can be found here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
::

We prefer Ubuntu as our distribution. So if you're happy with that recommendation, run this command in PowerShell as administrator to install WSL.


::note
Make sure to right click on the PowerShell icon and click <b>Run as Administrator.</b>
::

::code-panel
---
label: Install and use Ubuntu as your Windows Subsystem Linux distro
---
```bash
# Add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"
```
::

## Install Docker Desktop

Download and install the latest version of Docker Desktop from Docker's Website [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Configuration

If prompted, leave the default options checked.

### Accept the terms

Make sure you open "Docker Desktop" (double click the Docker Desktop icon from your Desktop) after install and accept the terms.

# Install Windows Terminal (Optional)

Although this application is still in preview, you may want to consider installing this for your best experience. You'll get tab support for CLIs and a few other bonus features.

You can install it from the Microsoft Store or from their Github page:<br /> [Download Windows Terminal →](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)

# Verify everything is working

::code-panel
---
label: Validate Docker is working (run this in Windows Terminal)
---
```bash
docker info
```
::

It should return version information.

::code-panel
---
label: Run a simple container to ensure Docker is working
---
```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
```
::

It should return something like this.

## TODO
* Need to add detailed instructions how to install `spin` on the Windows with WSL
