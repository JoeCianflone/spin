# Install to Windows
::lead-p
Spin is able to run on any Windows machine that supports Windows Subsystem Linux v2 (WLS2). This is a feature developed by Microsoft that allows you to run a Linux distribution on your Windows machine. It is supported in updated versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11.
::

## Prerequisites
Spin requires a working Windows installation with Docker installed. There are two popular methods to install Docker on Windows:

1. Install `docker-ce` on Windows Subsystem Linux v2 (WSL2) *\[recommended\]*
2. Install Docker Desktop on Windows with WSL2 backend

#### Optional software
You may want to consider installing this software to improve your development experience (this is what we use).
* [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) - This is a great terminal application that will give you tab support for your CLIs.

## Install Windows Subsystem Linux v2 (WSL2)
Both options require installing WSL2. We can follow the principles discussed in the [official WSL2 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and prepare our machine to run "Windows Subsystem Linux v2" (WSL2). We prefer Ubuntu as our distribution. So if you're happy with that recommendation, run this command in PowerShell as administrator to install WSL2.

::code-panel
---
label: Install and use Ubuntu as your Windows Subsystem Linux distro
---
```bash
wsl --install -d ubuntu
```
::

::note
A restart may be required.
::

![WSL Install Command](/images/docs/windows/wsl-install.png)

After a reboot, you may be prompted to create a username and password for your new Ubuntu installation. This is a separate user from your Windows user.

![WSL Create Username and Password](/images/docs/windows/wsl-configure.png)

Once configured, you can confirm is working by opening a new PowerShell window and running:

::code-panel
---
label: Enter the Ubuntu shell
---
```bash
wsl
```
::

::note
⚠️ Always be aware of what shell you're in (Windows or Ubuntu). You can always tell by the prompt.
::

### What a Windows shell looks like
You can tell you're in a Windows shell by the prompt when you see the `PS` prefix and the `C:\` prefix.
![Windows Shell](/images/docs/windows/shell-windows.png)

### What a Linux shell looks like
When you're in a Linux shell, you'll see the different colors and things like `/mnt/c` for your Windows drive.
![Linux Shell](/images/docs/windows/shell-linux.png)

To go back to your Windows shell, type `exit` and press enter.

::note
**⚠️ Always run `spin` from the Linux shell**. You'll need to run `wsl` from a Windows prompt to enter the Linux shell, then you can run `spin` after you complete the installation.
::

## OPTION 1: Install `docker-ce` within WSL2 (recommended)
Installing `docker-ce` within Linux allows you to run the open source versions of Docker without installing any proprietary software.

If this option interests you, run `wsl` to enter a Linux shell and then follow our instructions for installing Spin on Linux.

[Install Docker Community Edition to Linux (WSL2) →](/docs/installation/install-linux)

## OPTION 2: Install Docker Desktop
If you prefer to install Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend, you'll need to [download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) from Docker's website.

### Installation
Double click the setup file to begin the installation.

### Configuration

If prompted, leave the default options checked.

![Docker Configuration](/images/docs/windows/docker-desktop-configuration.png)

::note
Another restart may be required.
::

After the installation completes, you may be prompted to reboot your machine. If so, go ahead and do that.

![Docker Reboot](/images/docs/windows/docker-reboot.png)

### Accept the terms

Once your computer comes back online, click on the **Docker Desktop** icon. The application will initialize and be sure to accept the terms.

![Accept Docker EULA](/images/docs/windows/docker-accept-eula.png)

### Configuring your Docker Account

You will be prompted to login to your Docker account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free. For most cases, you can use Docker without creating an account.

![Docker Login](/images/docs/windows/docker-login.png)

## Verify Docker Desktop

::code-panel
---
label: Validate Docker is working (run this in Windows Terminal)
---
```bash
docker info
```
::

It should return version information.

![Docker Info](/images/docs/windows/docker-info.png)

::code-panel
---
label: Run a simple container to ensure Docker is working
---
```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
```
::

It should return something like this.

![Docker Run Hello World!](/images/docs/windows/docker-run-hello-world.png)

## Download and install `spin` into WSL2
::note
⚠️ Be sure to run `wsl` to enter the Linux shell before running the following commands.
::

Run the installer with this simple command in your terminal

::code-panel
---
label: Install Spin (no root permissions required)
---
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serversideup/spin/main/tools/install.sh)"
```
::

The above script will install spin at the _user_ level in `~/.spin`, using less than 300KB of storage.

## Add `spin` to your PATH
In order for your terminal to know where `spin` is located, we need to add this to your "PATH" for your shell. Depending on your shell, you will need to **paste the following text at the BOTTOM of the appropriate file**:


::code-panel
---
label: Add spin to your path (singe-line, hassle free)
---
```bash
echo $0 && { [ "$0" = "-bash" ] && file=~/.bash_profile || file=~/.zshrc; } && { [ -f "$file" ] || touch "$file"; } && grep -qxF 'export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"' "$file" || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.spin/bin:$PATH"' >> "$file" && source "$file" && echo "✅ Spin path added and sourced successfully!"
```
::

This giant command above does a few things:
- It checks to see if you're using Bash or ZSH
- It checks to see if your shell profile file exists
- It checks to see if the `spin` path is already added to your shell profile file
- If the `spin` path is not added, it adds it to the bottom of your shell profile file
- It sources your shell profile file so you don't have to restart your terminal

Just copy and paste the above command into your terminal and it will intelligently add the `spin` path to your shell profile file.

## Validate `spin` is working

::code-panel
---
label: Confirm spin is working correctly by getting the version
---
```bash
spin version
```
