## Pre-requisites
Windows requires a "Linux Subsystem" to run Docker. We will break this into two parts:

1. Install Windows Subsystem Linux (v2)
2. Install Docker Desktop

#### Optional software
You may want to consider installing this software to improve your development experience (this is what we use).
* [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) - This is a great terminal application that will give you tab support for your CLIs.

## Install Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)
We can follow the principles discussed in the [official WSL2 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and prepare our machine to run "Windows Subsystem Linux v2" (WSL2). We prefer Ubuntu as our distribution. So if you're happy with that recommendation, run this command in PowerShell as administrator to install WSL2.

::code-panel
---
label: Install and use Ubuntu as your Windows Subsystem Linux distro
---
```bash
wsl --install -d ubuntu
```
::

::note
A restart may be required.
::

After a reboot, you may be prompted to create a username and password for your new Ubuntu installation. This is a separate user from your Windows user.

![WSL Create Username and Password](/images/docs/windows/wsl-configure.png)

Once configured, you can confirm is working by opening a new PowerShell window and running:

::code-panel
---
label: Enter the Ubuntu shell
---
```bash
wsl
```
::

## Install Docker Desktop

Download and install the latest version of Docker Desktop from Docker's Website [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Configuration

If prompted, leave the default options checked.

::note
Another restart may be required.
::

After the installation completes, you may be prompted to reboot your machine. If so, go ahead and do that.

![Docker Reboot](/images/docs/windows/docker-reboot.png)

### Accept the terms

Once your computer comes back online, click on the **Docker Desktop** icon. The application will initialize and be sure to accept the terms.

### Configuring your Docker Account

You will be prompted to login to your Docker account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free. For most cases, you can use Docker without creating an account.

![Docker Login](/images/docs/windows/docker-login.png)

# Verify everything is working

::code-panel
---
label: Validate Docker is working (run this in Windows Terminal)
---
```bash
docker info
```
::

It should return version information.

![Docker Info](/images/docs/windows/docker-info.png)

::code-panel
---
label: Run a simple container to ensure Docker is working
---
```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
```
::

It should return something like this.

## TODO
* Need to add detailed instructions how to install `spin` on the Windows with WSL
